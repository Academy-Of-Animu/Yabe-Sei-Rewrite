# The same Yabe Sei, written in Rust
Yabe Sei is a Discord bot that has many purposes to help servers be easier to moderate and provide entertainment in many ways.

# Motivation
Yabe was brought into this world to provide tools to learn to program. Though her mission has changed a bit into something more multipurpose, she still helps us come together and assists communities in having more engagement. We want to achieve an open-source initiative and promise to never make Yabe proprietary, her code will always be available to learn from.

# Frameworks
Yabe's rewrite is being written in Rust using the [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) library. Some other notable libraries that make Yabe's rewrite possible are:
- [dotenv](https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv)
- [rusqlite](https://github.com/jgallagher/rusqlite)
- [log](https://github.com/rust-lang/log)

# Features
Though not yet completed, Yabe is being translated from a highly optimized JavaScript codebase, with features such as database operations to have interactive content with guilds and users alike, as well as music features and the like.

# Installation & How to Use
